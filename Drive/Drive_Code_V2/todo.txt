make sensor code more generic
  have ability to create sensors on the fly
    named sensors that take a value of a type
    possibly stored in a map to RT FIFOs
  each command can utilize sensors as necessary
  
create VIs for each drive train that perform the commands
  each VI will have a switch statement inside of it that switches based on command
  command will perform the actions necessary to perform the action
    calculate setpoints

Figure out how to handle drive values when the PID and Period update commands are sent
  driving shouldn't stop due to these commands
  possible solutions
    write previous values through
    send most recently sent command before PID/Period update commands sent immediately after the PID/Period update command
    
        add tolerances to the command finished checking for the notifier
          this should be handled in the drive train process command VIs
  
update TankProcessCommmands.vi to utillize the actual left right of the tank drive system instead of passing everything through cheesyDrive

create a document explaining what each command is and how to use them
create a document explaining the process to add commands to the drive architecture
  add a command send VI for the command
  modify each drive trains' ValidCommmands VI to include the new command (either with the command being valid or not)
  modify each drive trains' CommandProcess VI to be able to handle the new command (if it can)
create a document explaining the process to add a new drive train to the drive architecture
  create a CommandProcess VI for the new drive train that handles all of the comands it can
  create a ValidCommands VI for the new drive train that generates the list of Valid commands the drive train can handle
  add the drive train to the CreateDriveTrain polymorphic VI
  create a CreateDriveTrain VI for the new drive train
  see 1/13/18 notes
  
update command send VIs to be cleaner on the front panel and ensure all their names are correct

possible concerns:
sending the previous drive values through for PID and Period update will fix the
robot stopping on those commands being recieved, but the robot will not
continue proper behaviour, it will simply keep driving the way it did when those
commands were sent. need a way to continue previous behaviour

each command in the value selector portion of the control loop will need to pass in every single drive value from either the auto vals or
the non-PID vals.
  currently only the values necessary to make tank drive work are being properly assigned.


test the camera commands

add ability to set conditions for when the commands are finished
  current capability will be tolerances based upon sensor readings
    sensors used are determined by the current command
